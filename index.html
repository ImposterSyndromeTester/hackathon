			<p>What does Tina Fey, Dr. Margaret Chan (Chief of the WHO), Maya Angelo, Emma Watson, Kate Winslet, Neil Gamon and Don Cheadle all have in common?
			They have all felt like frauds who could be found out.  In fact approximately 70% of people have suffered from Imposter Syndrome.</p>
			<p>Imposter Sydrome can be divided into three subcategory:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Feelings of being a fake - the person feels that s/he does not deserve success.</li>
				<li>Attributing success to luck or other external reasons.</li>
				<li>Discounting success  - feelings that success is not a big deal.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>In truth, Imposter Syndrome is associated with highly achieving, highly successful people.
			It's the feeling that the person is a fraud when it is untrue.</p>

			<p>Ways to Overcome Imposter Syndrome</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Focus on the value you bring instead of attempts at perfection. Recognize that perfection does not exist.  Accept problems as little fires that help you improve and move forward.</li>
				<li>High achievers tend to feel imposter syndrome.  Giving your best is not the same as being the bet.  Overcoming the Imposter Syndrome requires self-acceptance. You don’t have to attain perfection or mastery to be worthy of your success or accomplishments.</li>
				<li>Stop the old internal conversations!  People with imposter feelings think "What will they think of me? What if they find out? If I fail they’ll shun me. I don’t know as much as that other guy..."The question becomes what is there for them to find out?  That you are a human?  It is okay to be human...mistakes and all. According to Terry Cole-Whitaker, "what you think of me is none of my business".  If people/colleagues/others are making judgements about you on the basis of the things you get right or get wrong, they are judging through their own feelings and perceived shortcomings.  It actually has nothing to do with you. So, let those old conversations go!</li>
				<li>Do not compare yourselves to others.  Author, Iyanla Vanzant states that “comparison is an act of violence against the self.” During moments of fear, you start thinking that everyone is smarter, that there things that you don’t know that they know, and that they expect you to know it all.  We often mistakenly assume others are getting by more effortlessly. The reality is that many people are stretched and struggling just like you with their own unique set of challenges, insecurities and internal struggles. So, even if you are acutely aware of how hard you are working to be successful, do your best and trust in your abilities.  No one deserves to be here more than you.</li>
				<li>If there is criticism, you can reframe what is being said. What if your code is not exactly perfect.  The person giving you advice could be coming from the standpoint of making your code as good as possible.  So, what if there is room for improvement?  “Don’t take anything personally because by taking things personally you set yourself up to suffer for nothing…When you truly understand this, and refuse to take things personally, you can hardly be hurt by comments.”  -Don Miguel Ruiz. Don't be afraid to be wrong, and do not take criticism of your work personally.</li>
				<h4>Advice For The Future</h4><p> Own your successes. When you receive positive feedback, embrace it with objectivity and internalize it. By denying it, you are downplaying that person’s judgement.Don’t attribute your successes to luck.Don’t talk about your abilities or successes with words like "merely," "only," "simply," etc.</p>

			<h3>So, You're Kind of an Imposter...</h3>
				<p>By selecting this option you are saying <i>"I am okay, but I have my moments"</i>. Doubt is a natural human response. The fact that you recognize your flaws and areas in which you are lacking is the KEY to success. Only then can you improve and change. It's important to keep an open mind on where you are on your journey and where you want to be. </p>

			<h3>So, You're Kind of an Imposter...</h3>
			<h4>Advice For The Future: </h4>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Adopt a growth mindset.</li> 
					<li>Don't think about what can happen in a month. Don't think about what can happen in a year. Just focus on the 24 hours in front of you and do what you can to get closer to where you want to be.</li>
					<li>DO NOT COMPARE YOURSELF TO OTHERS. This point is vital because we only see when others succeed yet are oblivious to their struggles. You are unique and there is always <b>more than meets the eye.</b></li>
